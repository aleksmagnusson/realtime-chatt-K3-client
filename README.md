# realtime-chatt-K3
The frontend part of the last assignment in the course Webbserverdatabaser. Another repo contains the backend part.

# How to start?
To easily start the app, download the "realtime-chatt-K3-server.

Open both Github repositories ["realtime-chatt-K3-client" & "realtime-chatt-K3-server"] with any programming software like "VsCode".
*run* ```npm install``` to install the dependencies you need.

When you have both open, run the start command script for each repository:
Frontend: 'npm run dev'
Backend: 'node server.js'

Open up the web-browser for the frontend. The socket.io and socket.io-client will automatically run by itself when both are in use.
Use the app "realtime-chatt-app" and try it out.

PS. I tried my best to make this work and always improve myself to evolve. This project has been harder than the most of others.
As they say; you search the information you need all the time to make it work!
